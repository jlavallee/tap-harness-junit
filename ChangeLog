0.39    Sun Jan 27 00:52:07 2013 -0800
======================================
[FIXES]
Relax time test regex a bit for Windows

0.38    Wed Nov  7 22:45:34 2012 -0800
======================================
[FIXES]

0.37	Sun Aug  5 16:05:52 2012 -0800
======================================
[ENHANCEMENTS]
JUNIT_PACKAGE prefix setting added by Richard Huxton
See RT78642

0.36	Tue Jun 14 14:49:18 2011 +0200
======================================
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Per-assert timing info is now much more accurate.

0.35 	Wed Mar  2 21:05:13 2011 -0800
======================================
[FIXES]
Fix for RT66256

0.34    Sun Feb 27 15:48:05 2011 -0800
======================================
[ENHANCEMENTS]
The name of the JUnit output file can now be set using the
environment variable $JUNIT_OUTPUT_FILE - see RT60063
[FIXES]
The tests no longer rely on "cat", and should pass on Windows

0.33	Sat Feb 26 11:15:45 2011 -0800
======================================
[FIXES]
If an output of test was of length zero, TAP::Parser would not
recognize it as TAP output and would panic. We help it by adding
a single line break.
RT49307 - system-out content is not escaped
RT56521 - Catching no_plan errors
RT53657 - Error using namemangle option with ::newA
RT53730 - test output takes forever on lots of unnamed tests
[DOCUMENTATION]
git repository location changed

0.32	Mon Jul 13 17:31:25 2009 +0200
======================================
[FIXES]
Tests were timed not time separately, but aggregated duration
of the whole test run was used.

[DOCUMENTATION]
Recommend using the perl name mangling

0.31	Mon Jul 13 08:59:27 2009 +0200
======================================
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Make test name mangling configurable
More recent Hudson versions cope with this well, we don't want to
arbitrarily change the test names now, to retain compatibility.

Make up timing information for tests
Hudson ignores the testcase duration, computes it as sum of
test times.

0.30	Thu Apr 16 17:46:03 2009 +0200
======================================
[ENHANCEMENTS]
Use TAP::Harness::Aggregator->elapsed to set the elapsed time for testcases

Added "notimes" paramter that prevents timing of test cases
made use of that parameter in t/outputs.t

Remove SPEC file from here -- master copy is Fedora devel

0.26	Sat Jan 3 00:53:44 2009 +0100
======================================
[FIXES]
Do not call /bin/cat to get TAP output into parser (rt#41344)

Make 'xmlfile' optional (rt#42069)

Ensure valid UTF-8 output
Do not report failed plain and bad return value as two failures

[ENHANCEMENTS]
Iteratively choose name for tests with ambigious names to prevent deep recursion warnings for long tests
Improve the output for tests with broken plan a bit
